      <img src="assets/images/portrait.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Photo of Patrick">

        <p>I am a web development student living in Philadelphia. I grew up in the suburbs of NYC, and 
        got my BS in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) from Rutgers University-New Brunswick. 
        I then went to Drexel University, where I got my PhD in MSE. During this time, I discovered several new 
        nanomaterials that have potential applications in quantum computers among others.</p>
        
        <p>During my experiences in academia and industry, I was exposed to coding languages including 
        C++ and Matlab. Using these languages to answer puzzling questions taught me about
        the powers of coding. My interest in design, however, fueled my passion for  
        web development. Creating a better user experience, innovation and problem-solving are my motivations.</p>
    
        <p>Some of my other interests and hobbies are DJ-ing, music production, 
        woodworking, furniture making, film history and film production.</p>
